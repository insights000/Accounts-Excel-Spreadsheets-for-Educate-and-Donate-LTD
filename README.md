Educate and Donate is a micro limited company ran by a teacher who has veteran experience teaching a wide variety of subjects to students, private limited. The company asked me to do some work on their accounts and this project will involve me going through what I did to help them improve their sheet and the deductions that I made in cleaning and organizing their data, for the purpose of confidenality and data protection and GDPR regulations I cannot share the Excel Spreadsheet that contains the information of the said statement on it there however, I can walkthrough what exactly I did for them.
